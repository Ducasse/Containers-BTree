# Containers-BTree (underway...)

This package is part of the Containers project: This project is to collect, clean, test and document alternate collection datastructures.
Each package is modular so that users can only load the collection they need without 100 of related collections. 

The BTree package is under work.

I'm not sure but it may have been originally developed by L. Ramon. 

The best way to predict the future is to do it!
